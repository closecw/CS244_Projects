# Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects created in my undergraduate Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) course. 
Some of these projects are informal, focused on demonstrating one concept or algorithm.
Other projects are formal, focused on demonstrating a broader understanding of multiple data structures or algorithms in combination.

## Summary

A brief summary of the projects included:

### Informal Projects

- **Assignment2** - *Fractional Knapsack*
  - Implements the greedy solution for the knapsack problem.
- **Assignment3** - *Whole (0/1) Knapsack*
  - Demonstrates understanding of dynamic programming for the whole knapsack problem.
- **Assignment6** - *Bin Sorting*
  - Solves the bin packing problem using both the First Fit and Next Fit approaches. 

### Formal Projects

- **Project1** - *Postfix Expression Evaluation*
  - Uses a **stack** to evaluate postfix mathematical expressions. Demonstrates string parsing and stack-based programming.
- **Project2** - *Huffman Coding*
  - Implements the **Huffman Coding** algorithm using **priority queues** and **maps**. Demonstrates greedy algorithms and compression methods. 
- **Project3** - *Stable Matching*
  - Implements the **Gale-Shapley** algorithm to solve the NxN stable matching problem using **queues**, **maps**, and **vectors**. Demonstrates algorithmic implementations and combining several data structures, as well as stability and matching.
 
## Cloning and Running

Feel free to clone and run the individual files in this repository. 
All I ask is that these files be seen as one implementation of their topic. They are not the only implementation. **You should not copy this code.** 
I **strongly** encourage writing your own implementation of these.

To clone, run:
```
git clone https://github.com/closecw/CS244_Projects.git
```

Files should be run on an individual basis, as they are not designed to work together. 
C++17 or later is recommended for full compatibility.
